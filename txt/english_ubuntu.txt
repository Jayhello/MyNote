CMake lets you create text variables. For this purpose, the set() command is used.
set (MY_VAR "hello")
To refer to a variable later on, simply enclose it in the round braces prepended by a dollar sign:
set (OTHER_VAR "${MY_VAR} world!")

You’ll notice that, by default, CLion will attempt to aggregate all 
project source files into a single variable as follows:
set (SOURCE_FILES foo.cpp bar.cpp baz.cpp)

aggregate   vi. 集合；聚集；合计vt. 集合；聚集；合计
			n. 合计；集合体；总计adj. 聚合的；集合的；合计的
in the aggregate 总计，总共，合计，整个，作为总体，总的来说
